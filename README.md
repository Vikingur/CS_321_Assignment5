# CS_321_Assignment5
The supplied and student-built code for Assignment 5.

To clone this code, locate the URL below next to the
tab marked HTTPS, or possibly SSH. Then, in Git Bash,
type in "git clone", add a space, and then type the
same URL. Press enter, and the code will be moved to
your local directory.

From there, exit Git Bash and use the regular Windows
command line. Re-direct to the "CS_321_Assignment5"
directory.

Now, to compile the files, type "javac *.java". This
runs the Java compiler on all java files in the 
directory. Once that's finished, input an instruction
file by typing "java HRS", a space, and then the name
of your instruction file.
